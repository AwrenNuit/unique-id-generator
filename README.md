# Unique Password Generator

## Description
This is a secure password generator. By default the lowercase letters are checked. Users can check uppercase letters, numbers, dash and underscore, and/or a collection of symbols to be included in their unique ID. Clicking GENERATE appends the randomly-spawned password below the button. Users can click GENERATE as many times as they wish. It will supply a new ID each time.
